- ASP.NET / EF Core web application.

Run Tracker allows users to log their runs and keep track of the mileage on their shoes.  If a shoe is no longer in use it can be retired and will no long be an option when creating a run. If no database or an empty data is found on start up one will be created and seeded with test data.

Utilizes: 
    -C#
    -JavaScript
    -jQuery
    -Bootstrap
    -Chartist.js

The core functionality of this web application has already been implemented. Users can create, view, sort, and alter both runs and shoes.

Currently I am working on a detailed profile page that will display user data such as personal bests, total mileage, frequency and distance of runs etc.
